# cake
By far the most useless thing I have ever coded. Add cakes to the console.
```javascript
cake(n) // Returns a cake with n candles (adjusted for console).
cake(n, false) // Returns a cake with n candles, but is offset in the console
```
You actually want to use this? Here: ```<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ollybritton/cake/master/cake.js"></script>```
